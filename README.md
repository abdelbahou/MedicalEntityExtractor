# French Medical NER with DrBERT üß¨

A Streamlit application for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in French medical texts using a fine-tuned DrBERT model.

## Overview

This project provides a web interface for extracting medical entities from French clinical text using a transformer model fine-tuned on the QUAERO medical corpus. The application supports real-time entity extraction and provides interactive visualizations of the results.


the ner_project.ipynb notebook demonstrates the development and evaluation of  various approaches, from traditional machine learning to transformer-based models.
